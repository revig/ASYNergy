## How Can I Contribute?


### Code Contribution

Make your contributions to ASYNergy in the form of pull requests on the [ASYNergy repository](https://github.com/revig/ASYNergy/) on GitHub.  
revIgniter adheres to the [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) process. This workflow requires that all commits need to be made to "develop" and all pull requests need to be sent to the "develop" branch.  
Before generating a significant pull request (new features, refactoring code etc.) please ask. Otherwise you risk spending a lot of time on something the project's developers might be reluctant to merge into the project.  
Please note: By sending a pull request to the [ASYNergy repository](https://github.com/revig/ASYNergy/) on GitHub, you certify to a "Developer's Certificate of Origin" as in [DCO.txt](DCO.txt) located in the root of this repository. This requires you to sign your work like `git commit --signoff`.

**Git Commit Messages**

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Sign your work.
