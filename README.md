# ASYNergy

ASYNergy is a revIgniter JavaScript application, inspired by  
and adopted from Livewire, but it is nowhere near as  
feature-rich as Livewire and doesn't claim to be on par with  
Livewire. It is a framework for making network requests and  
changing things on the page. Its name is a compound of the  
words "asynchronous", from "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML",  
and "synergy", meaning the synergy between the two frameworks  
ASYNergy and revIgniter.     
  
| :warning: | **ASYNergy's current state is pre-release/beta-release, it is not ready for production use.** <br> Serious bugs and unexpected behavior cannot be ruled out. |
